## [1.1.3] - 2026-09-04

### Fixed
- **`pnpm test` crashed instantly in every scaffolded app.** `apps/web/vitest.setup.ts` and `packages/iam/vitest.config.ts` were never added to `package.json`'s `files` array, so they never shipped to npm — while the root `vitest.config.ts` (which does ship) references the former by absolute path. Every generated project's test suite failed outright with `Cannot find module`. Both files are now included.
- **CLI-only runtime dependencies leaked into every generated app's `package.json`.** `@clack/prompts`/`picocolors` (added for the interactive wizard in 1.1.1) are meaningless in a scaffolded Next.js/Fastify starter; `transformProjectMetadata` now strips them like it already does for `bin`, `files`, and the CLI's own publish scripts.
- **`scripts/security-audit.test.ts` was copied into every generated app and failed there.** It shells out to `git ls-files` and asserts against *this* repo's own tracked-file set and identity — neither means anything once renamed and rescaffolded. This and its sibling CLI-development-only scripts (`verify-release.ts`, `smoke-test.ts`, `dogfood-test.ts`) are no longer copied into scaffolded projects.
- **`scripts/verify-release.ts` never actually ran the generated application.** It checked file *existence* only; none of the three bugs above would have reached npm as `1.1.2` if it had. It now runs `pnpm install && pnpm test` against the real scaffolded output before every release.

---

## [1.1.2] - 2026-09-04

### Changed
- Release build, dependencies validation, and npm deployment with full support for OIDC Trusted Publishing and interactive CLI prompts.

---

## [1.1.1] - 2026-09-03

### Fixed
- **Interactive CLI prompts actually ship.** 1.1.0's release commit landed only the shadcn/ui redesign half of the feature; `src/prompts.ts` and the `cli.ts`/`generator.ts` wiring for it, along with `next-themes`/`sonner` integration (`theme-provider.tsx`, `theme-toggle.tsx`, `sonner.tsx`, `tooltip.tsx`, and the root layout wiring), were dropped before commit and are restored here.
- `@clack/prompts` and `picocolors` moved from `devDependencies` to `dependencies` — as dev-only deps they were never installed for anyone running the published package, so the interactive wizard would have thrown `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` on first use.
- `--theme <name>` is now actually parsed outside the interactive prompt path; it was documented in `--help` but silently ignored when combined with `-y`/`--yes`.
- `scripts/verify-release.ts` now installs the packed artifact's production dependencies before executing it, matching what `npx create-odoo-app` does for a real user — it previously ran `dist/cli.js` straight out of the tarball with no `node_modules`, which is why the two bugs above weren't caught before publishing.

---

## [1.1.0] - 2026-09-03

### Added
- **Interactive CLI Setup (`@clack/prompts`)**:
  - Beautiful, accessible terminal prompts when running `npx create-odoo-app <dir>` without `-y` / `--yes`.
  - Configurable project name, color palette theme (`neutral`, `zinc`, `violet`, `rose`), architecture modules (IAM Governance, Prometheus Observability, S3/MinIO Object Storage), Git initialization, and automated dependency installation.
  - Automatic non-interactive fallback for CI / scripting workflows with `-y` or non-TTY environments.
- **Modern shadcn/ui Component Suite in `apps/web`**:
  - Integrated Radix UI primitives: `@radix-ui/react-avatar`, `@radix-ui/react-dialog`, `@radix-ui/react-dropdown-menu`, `@radix-ui/react-label`, `@radix-ui/react-select`, `@radix-ui/react-separator`, `@radix-ui/react-slot`, `@radix-ui/react-switch`, `@radix-ui/react-tabs`, `@radix-ui/react-tooltip`.
  - Built comprehensive, modular UI components in `apps/web/src/components/ui/` (`Button`, `Card`, `Input`, `Label`, `Badge`, `Dialog`, `DropdownMenu`, `Tabs`, `Table`, `Avatar`, `Switch`, `Select`, `Separator`, `Skeleton`, `Alert`, `Tooltip`, `Toaster`, `ThemeToggle`).
  - Integrated `next-themes` for seamless Dark / Light / System mode switching.
  - Integrated `sonner` for rich, animated toast notifications across all user actions.
- **Modernized User Interface & Design System**:
  - Redesigned Landing page (`apps/web/src/app/page.tsx`) with dynamic architecture visualizers, live system status probes, and hero actions.
  - Redesigned Authentication pages (`/login`, `/signup`) with cryptographic session badges and developer credentials prefilling.
  - Redesigned User Dashboard (`/dashboard`) and Profile (`/profile`) with avatar initials, live effective IAM permission badges, and secure password updates.
  - Redesigned IAM Admin Console (`/admin`, `/admin/iam/*`) with modern Data Tables, interactive status toggles, granular policy statement inspectors, and group/role managers.
- **Modernized Agent Skills**:
  - Updated `skills/frontend/SKILL.md` with shadcn/ui component documentation, Radix primitives, and UI testing patterns.
  - Verified and packaged all 14 Agent Skills into deterministic ZIP archives in `dist/skills/`.


### Security
- **Upgraded `drizzle-orm` to `^0.45.2`**, which patches a SQL injection advisory affecting every version below it. The previous `^0.39.3` range could never reach the fix.
- **Patched three transitive advisories** via `overrides` in `pnpm-workspace.yaml`: `postcss` (path traversal / arbitrary file read, reached through `next`) and `@fastify/static` (route guard and authorization bypass, reached through `@fastify/swagger-ui`). `pnpm audit --prod` now reports zero vulnerabilities, and CI fails on any new one.
- **Stopped `passwordHash` leaking through the API.** `updateUserStatus` returned an unprojected `users` row and its route declared `200: z.any()`, so Fastify's response serializer stripped nothing. All 14 `z.any()` IAM response schemas are replaced with real ones, and user reads go through a single `SAFE_USER_COLUMNS` projection.
- **Per-project secrets.** Every generated app previously shipped the same `SESSION_SECRET` and `INITIAL_ROOT_PASSWORD`, both public in `.env.example`. The CLI now mints unique values per project and prints the root password once. The API refuses to start with `NODE_ENV=production` while any published default remains, listing every offender at once.
- **Policy `resources` and `conditions` are now evaluated.** Both fields existed on `PolicyStatement` and were accepted by the API, but the engine ignored them: a policy scoped to one resource granted the action on all of them. Resource matching supports exact, prefix-wildcard and `*`; conditions support `StringEquals`, `StringNotEquals`, `Bool` and `OwnerEquals`, and fail closed on an unrecognised operator.
- **`:self` ownership now fails closed.** The check previously ran only when `resourceOwnerId` was supplied, so a route that omitted it skipped the gate entirely.
- **Blocked privilege escalation through policy attachment.** Holding `policies:update` was enough to attach an `allow *` policy to your own account. Grants are now rejected unless the actor already holds every permission being conferred.
- **Protected system records.** The `isSystem` flag was set by the seed and enforced nowhere; deleting the default external-user policy silently broke all future signups. System roles, groups and policies are now immutable through the API.
- **Protected the ROOT identity.** Any holder of `users:update` could suspend the ROOT account and lock the platform out. ROOT suspension and self-suspension are now refused.
- **Fixed rate limiting behind a proxy.** The limiter allowlisted `127.0.0.1`, which behind nginx, a load balancer or Docker ingress matched every request and disabled rate limiting entirely — including on `/auth/login`. The allowlist is gone and a `TRUST_PROXY` setting configures `request.ip` correctly.
- **Added per-email login lockout** (`LoginThrottle`), enforcing the previously decorative `AuthConfig.maxLoginAttempts`. Degrades to no-lockout if Redis is unavailable rather than causing an authentication outage.
- **Closed the login timing oracle.** An unknown email returned before any hashing, making account existence measurable. A dummy scrypt verification now runs on that path.
- **Hardened Docker Compose.** Services bind to `127.0.0.1` by default instead of `0.0.0.0`; Redis now actually receives `REDIS_PASSWORD`; Grafana anonymous access is off by default and its credentials are configurable; MinIO images are pinned instead of `:latest`.
- **Scoped the Swagger CSP.** `script-src 'unsafe-inline'` was applied to the entire API to make one HTML page render; it now applies only to `/api/docs`.
- **Fixed the cross-site session cookie.** `sameSite` was a no-op ternary returning `'lax'` in both branches, silently dropping the session cookie when web and API are on different hosts.

### Fixed
- Removed 24 committed build artifacts from `packages/config/src`. Vite and Node both resolve a sibling `./x.js` ahead of `./x.ts`, so the stale compiled output was shadowing the TypeScript source at test time. `.gitignore` now prevents recurrence.
- `create-odoo-app .` no longer overwrites a non-empty current directory, and no longer prints a `cd` step for a directory you are already in.
- Removed the `--skip-infra` flag, which was parsed and advertised but never used.
- Generated projects no longer inherit `ignore-scripts` (which permanently suppressed install scripts for the user's own dependencies) or the generator's `repository`, `bugs`, `homepage` and `author` fields.
- Signup is now transactional; a failed policy attachment previously left an account with no permissions and an unusable email address.
- The error handler no longer reports unmapped 4xx statuses as `INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR`, and now surfaces domain error codes such as `PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION_BLOCKED`.
- `verify:release` no longer fails on Windows checkouts outside `C:` — GNU tar was reading the absolute archive path as a remote `host:path` spec.
- The seed script shares `hashPassword` with the login path instead of reimplementing scrypt, which would have drifted the moment the parameters were tuned.
- `@packages/config` no longer re-exports the Node-only env loader from its main entry point, which would break the Next.js client build for anyone following the README's advice to configure the app there. Server code imports `@packages/config/env`.

### Changed
- **Replaced the placeholder `lint` scripts.** Every package ran `echo "lint ok"`; there was no ESLint config in the repo, so `pnpm verify` and the CI lint step always passed. Real ESLint now runs with `--max-warnings 0`, and the 29 unused imports and `any` annotations it found are fixed.
- **Tightened vacuous test assertions.** Five tests accepted a range of status codes wide enough to pass whether the endpoint worked or crashed — including the privilege-escalation test, which allowed `[201, 400, 500, 503]`. Database-dependent tests now skip explicitly rather than passing without running.
- **Added coverage thresholds.** `test:coverage` previously reported numbers nothing acted on. A global floor plus stricter floors on the policy engine (now 100% statements) and password crypto.
- Test suite grew from 110 to 165 tests.
- CI now runs a dependency vulnerability audit, and a dedicated Linux job exercises migrations and the seed script against real PostgreSQL and Redis containers.
- `AuthConfig.registrationEnabled` and `minPasswordLength` are enforced instead of being documented knobs that did nothing.
- Signup rejects unknown request fields outright (`.strict()`) rather than silently discarding them.

## [1.0.10] - 2026-09-02

### Fixed
- Automated silent and safe pnpm dependency installs: configured `ignore-scripts=true` in `.npmrc` and invoked `pnpm install --ignore-scripts` during project generation to ensure immediate, error-free setup on pnpm v10 and v11.

## [1.0.9] - 2026-09-02

### Fixed
- Fixed pnpm v10/v11 `ERR_PNPM_IGNORED_BUILDS` on scaffolded apps: cleanly configured `onlyBuiltDependencies` in `pnpm-workspace.yaml` allowing esbuild and Next.js native binaries to run builds without prompting `pnpm approve-builds`.
- Cleaned up `.npmrc` configuration across workspace.

## [1.0.8] - 2026-09-02

### Fixed
- Fixed unstyled frontend: packaged `apps/web/postcss.config.mjs`, `apps/web/next.config.mjs`, and `apps/web/components.json` in published npm bundle so Tailwind CSS generates all styles in scaffolded Next.js apps.
- Updated `pnpm-workspace.yaml` with `onlyBuiltDependencies: [esbuild]` to eliminate pnpm configuration deprecation warnings.

## [1.0.7] - 2026-09-02

### Fixed
- Direct TypeScript source exports for workspace packages: updated `packages/*/package.json` exports to point directly to `src/index.ts`, enabling instant hot-reloading, `pnpm db:migrate`, and `pnpm db:seed` without requiring pre-compilation of `dist`.
- Updated MinIO and MinIO Client image tags in `docker-compose.yml` to standard reliable tags.

## [1.0.6] - 2026-09-02

### Fixed
- Fixed `npm error code EUNSUPPORTEDPROTOCOL` on `npx create-odoo-app`: removed `workspace:*` dependencies from root `package.json` so `npm` and `npx` install and execute the generator cleanly on all platforms.
- Configured path aliases in root `tsconfig.json` so root scripts (`scripts/health-check.ts`, `scripts/setup.ts`) resolve internal packages directly.

## [1.0.5] - 2026-09-02

### Fixed
- Workspace package resolution in root scripts: configured root `dependencies` and `tsconfig.base.json` path mappings so root scripts (`pnpm health`, `pnpm setup`, `scripts/health-check.ts`) resolve `@packages/*` directly in both generator and generated monorepo apps.

## [1.0.4] - 2026-09-01

### Added
- Preconfigured `.gitignore` file automatically created in all scaffolded applications, ignoring `node_modules`, `.pnpm-store`, environment secrets (`.env`, `.env.*`), build outputs (`dist`, `.next`), coverage, temporary files, and Docker volume data directories.
- Filtered out `.npmignore` from generated projects.

## [1.0.3] - 2026-09-01

### Added
- Preconfigured `.gitignore` file guaranteed to be created in all scaffolded applications, ignoring `node_modules`, `.pnpm-store`, environment secrets (`.env`, `.env.*`), build outputs (`dist`, `.next`), coverage, temporary files, and Docker volume data directories.
- Filtered out `.npmignore` from generated projects.

## [1.0.2] - 2026-09-01

### Fixed
- Transformed root build/typecheck scripts in generated applications so `tsc -p tsconfig.cli.json` is not executed in generated projects.

## [1.0.1] - 2026-09-01

### Fixed
- Tailored scripts in generated user applications: removed generator-specific CLI build/release scripts (`build:cli`, `verify:release`, `release:check`, `release:pack`, `test:smoke`, `test:dogfood`) from generated `package.json`.
- Streamlined `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm build`, and `pnpm verify` commands in generated projects.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-08-30

### Added
- **Project Generator (`create-odoo-app`)**:
  - Executable CLI (`npx create-odoo-app@latest <project-name>`) supporting project scaffolding, argument parsing, help (`-h`), version (`-v`), and skip flags (`--skip-install`, `--skip-git`, `--skip-infra`).
  - Deterministic project metadata and branding transformations (`package.json`, `app-config.ts`, Next.js `<title>`, navbar branding, OpenAPI title, tailored `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`).
  - Template isolation filter preventing leakage of `.git`, `node_modules`, `dist`, `.next`, `brain/`, and local credentials.
- **Identity, Authentication & IAM System**:
  - Password hashing with Node native `scrypt` and timing-safe comparison (`crypto.timingSafeEqual`).
  - Server-side session management (`SessionManager`) with SHA-256 token hashing in PostgreSQL and Redis caching.
  - HTTP-only session cookies (`SameSite=Lax`, `Path=/`, `Secure` in production).
  - IAM Policy Evaluation Engine enforcing **Explicit Deny Precedence**, **ROOT superuser authority**, wildcard pattern matching (`users:*`), and resource ownership checks (`:self`).
  - Declarative Fastify route guards (`requireAuthentication`, `requirePermission`, `requireAnyPermission`).
  - Next.js Admin IAM Control Center (`/admin`, `/admin/iam/users`, `/admin/iam/roles`, `/admin/iam/groups`, `/admin/iam/policies`, `/admin/iam/permissions`) with live Effective Permissions Calculation view.
- **OpenAPI & Structured Logging Hardening (Phase 5.1)**:
  - Universal structured logger in `@packages/shared` with automatic defensive sensitive data redaction (`password`, `token`, `secret`, `apiKey`, `cookie`, `authorization`, `databaseUrl`, `SESSION_SECRET`).
  - Fastify request correlation ID propagation (`x-request-id` header sanitization and onSend response tracing).
  - Correlated error payloads (`HttpErrorResponse`) containing matching `requestId` for client diagnostics without stack trace leakage.
  - Accurate OpenAPI 3.0 `CookieAuth` security scheme (`app_session` cookie) and standard reusable error schemas.
  - Operational event logging across Auth (`auth.signup.success`, `auth.login.failure`, `auth.logout`, `auth.session.revoked`) and IAM (`iam.user.status_updated`, `iam.role.assigned`).
- **Real Agent Skills Standard & Skill Discovery Architecture (Phase 6)**:
  - Agent Skills open-standard compliant skill bundles with matching directory names and YAML frontmatter (`name`, `description`).
  - Machine-readable skill registry (`skills/index.yaml`) cataloging all 13 canonical skills.
  - Automated skill validation tooling (`scripts/check-skills.ts` / `pnpm skills:check`).
  - Localized subtree `AGENTS.md` context files (`apps/api/AGENTS.md`, `apps/web/AGENTS.md`, `packages/auth/AGENTS.md`, `packages/iam/AGENTS.md`, `packages/db/AGENTS.md`).
  - Propagation of skills registry and localized context manuals into generated projects.
- **Agent Skills Runtime Compatibility, Packaging & Discovery Hardening (Phase 6.1)**:
  - Deterministic skill bundle packer (`scripts/pack-skills.ts` / `pnpm skills:pack`) outputting clean directory bundles and standard zero-dependency ZIP archives in `dist/skills/` compatible with OpenAI Skills API and portable Agent Skills platform consumption.
  - Skill CLI utilities: `pnpm skills:list`, `pnpm skills:show <name>`, `pnpm skills:lint`, and `pnpm skills:export`.
  - Deterministic context discovery & skill packaging automated test suite (`src/skills.test.ts`).
  - Skill composition matrix and clean separation of repository guidance (`AGENTS.md`) from portable skill bundles (`skills/*/`).
- **Dependency Modernization, CI Bootstrap Repair & Dogfooding Verification (Phase 6.2)**:
  - Fixed GitHub Actions pnpm bootstrap failure across Ubuntu and Windows matrix using `actions/setup-node@v4` with native `corepack enable` and `corepack prepare pnpm@11.1.0 --activate`.
  - Added automated dependency baseline checking tool (`scripts/check-deps.ts` / `pnpm deps:check`).
  - Added 14th canonical skill: `skills/dependencies/SKILL.md` (Monorepo dependency inventory, safe upgrades, lockfile integrity).
  - Implemented end-to-end generator dogfooding test suite (`scripts/dogfood-test.ts` / `pnpm test:dogfood`) testing scaffolding, metadata transforms, skill verification, and clean unpacked distribution.
  - Formalized permanent dependency upgrade policy (Rule 11) in `AGENTS.md`.
- **Developer Configuration Surface (`packages/config`)**:
  - `app-config.ts`: Application constants, metadata, pagination limits.
  - `auth-config.ts`: Authentication settings (`registrationEnabled`, `defaultIdentity`, `sessionTtlSeconds`, `cookieName`, `minPasswordLength`).
  - `iam-config.ts`: Declarative domain roles, groups, default policies, and baseline role-policy assignments.
  - `feature-config.ts`: Optional feature toggles (`enableSwagger`, `enableMetrics`, `enableStorage`, `enableRedis`, `enableEmail`).
- **Comprehensive Quality Gates & Testing Architecture**:
  - Multi-tier testing pyramid: unit tests, Fastify `app.inject()` integration tests, adversarial security tests, generator smoke tests, and packed tarball release verification (`pnpm verify:release`).
  - Coverage analysis with `@vitest/coverage-v8`.
  - GitHub Actions CI/CD workflows (`ci.yml` and `release.yml`).
