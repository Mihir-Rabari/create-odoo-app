## 1. Monorepo Architecture & Package Boundaries

This repository is a **pnpm workspaces monorepo** and generator for production-ready full-stack applications. Strict layering and boundary enforcement prevent architectural degradation:

## 2. Inviolable Security & Architectural Rules

1. **Rule 1**: Frontend must never access PostgreSQL, Redis, or MinIO credentials directly.
2. **Rule 2**: Backend owns security-sensitive operations, data persistence, and authorization.
3. **Rule 3**: Packages in `packages/*` must not depend on `apps/*`.
4. **Rule 4**: Infrastructure configuration (ports, hosts, credentials) must be read from `packages/config` / `.env`, never hardcoded.
5. **Rule 5**: No circular dependencies between workspace packages.
6. **Rule 6**: Prefer small composable abstractions over giant catch-all utilities.
7. **Rule 7**: Do not duplicate environment parsing logic; always import `getEnv()` from `@packages/config`.
8. **Rule 8**: Validate all external inputs at API boundaries using Zod schemas.
9. **Rule 9**: Do not couple application logic to MinIO-specific endpoints; use the `StorageService` abstraction.
10. **Rule 10 (Authorization)**:
    - `ROOT` identity has unconditional administrative authority.
    - Explicit `DENY` statements strictly override `ALLOW` statements.
    - Self-resource permissions (`:self`) strictly enforce that `context.resourceOwnerId === identity.id`.
    - Suspended and disabled accounts are denied all authenticated operations.
11. **Rule 11 (Dependency Upgrade Policy)**:
    - Do not blindly upgrade dependencies.
    - Check current stable version and read relevant migration notes.
    - Verify peer compatibility across Node 20/22, Next.js, Fastify, Drizzle, and Zod.
    - Update `pnpm-lock.yaml` deterministically; CI enforces frozen lockfiles (`--frozen-lockfile`).
    - Run targeted tests, generator smoke test, and full quality gate before completing any upgrade.

## 3. Agent-Enforced Testing Doctrine & Quality Rules

All automated coding agents and software engineers must strictly adhere to these testing laws:

1. **Rule T1 (Verification Requirement)**: Every new behavior must have automated tests proving its correctness.
2. **Rule T2 (Regression Defense)**: Every bug fix must include a permanent regression test capturing the discovered failure condition.
3. **Rule T3 (Security Adversarial Testing)**: Security-sensitive changes require explicit adversarial negative tests (privilege escalation, unauthorized access, expired sessions, mismatched resource ownership).
4. **Rule T4 (API Contracts)**: Every API route must be tested with Fastify `app.inject()` verifying validation (400), authentication (401), authorization (403), and success shapes.
5. **Rule T5 (Database Integrity)**: Database schema modifications require migration verification and seed idempotency tests.
6. **Rule T6 (Generator Smoke Coverage)**: Generator changes must pass full distributable smoke testing (`pnpm test:smoke`, `pnpm test:dogfood`, `pnpm verify:release`).
7. **Rule T7 (Quality Gates)**: Do not reduce coverage thresholds or delete tests to make a build pass.
8. **Rule T8 (Pre-Completion Verification)**: Always run the full verification gate (`pnpm verify`) before declaring any task complete.

## 4. Standard Development & Quality Verification Commands

All commands should be executed from the repository root:

```

## 5. Structured Logging & Observability Rules

1. **Use the Shared Logger**: Always import `logger` or `createLogger` from `@packages/shared`.
2. **No `console.log`**: Never use `console.log`, `console.error`, or `console.warn` in backend application code.
3. **Request Correlation**: Every HTTP request must have an `x-request-id` header generated or sanitized by Fastify.
4. **Error Correlation**: Every unexpected error must produce a structured server log and return a sanitized `HttpErrorResponse` containing `requestId`. Never expose stack traces to clients.
5. **Defensive Redaction**: Never log passwords, tokens, session cookies, database connection strings, or secrets.
6. **OpenAPI Synchronization**: Keep OpenAPI route schemas and `CookieAuth` security schemes synchronized with actual route behavior.

## 6. Agent Skills Standard, Discovery & Composition

This repository provides 14 standardized Agent Skills under `skills/` following the **Agent Skills open standard**. Use `skills/index.yaml` as the machine-readable discovery registry.

### Repository Guidance vs Skill Bundles
- **`AGENTS.md`**: Persistent repository operating manual describing architecture, commands, and rules.
- **`skills/*/`**: Portable, self-contained workflow instruction bundles that can be individually loaded by agents or packaged into ZIP archives for Agent Skills platforms.

### Targeted Context Loading Workflow
Before modifying a subsystem:
1. **Identify**: Review the Skills Index below to find the governing skill(s).
2. **Read**: Open and read the relevant `SKILL.md` file(s).
3. **Follow Constraints**: Apply the rules, conventions, and invariants documented in the skill.
4. **Implement & Test**: Add automated tests proving correctness.
5. **Verify**: Run `pnpm verify` to satisfy all repository quality gates.
